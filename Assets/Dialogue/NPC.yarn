    Hello stranger.
    <<AutoContinue>> 
    Where did you come from? 
    -> I don't know... 
        Hmmm..
        I don't know how you got here, but watch your step. The man ahead isn't very friendly... 
    -> I came to fight the cave dweller.
        I see. Be careful. He is a force to be reckoned with.
